Here is the contracts. 
It already has everything we need, 
we just need to change the names, price and number of mints

We just need to add one function to it. 
The price for the new mint will increase by 20% every time someone mints a token/nft
right not the price is a constant variable in that contracts - 

we need to change just that.

front end is just one page like this: http://mint.worldofumans.com/


1. We are cloning that site for another project, yes.
2. Price will change like 5% per mint - random mint (by script or we just add random order)
3. 50 NFTs are given (the umans one had 500)
4. Users can mint, view, transfer and see attributes (same as Umans)

The contracts right now works the same except the price incrementation isn't it?

It also shows the jpeg and everything is exactly same - we are changing price, number of mints and adding static price to a dynamic incrementing price


for the NFT thing
How do we store and deliver the jpegs? and also the contract gives random jpegs when someone mints it?
or we randomise the jpegs first and upload? pls tell how it works
